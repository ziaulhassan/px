Toutorial#(004 What is React_)
Its library of javascript and react-native is used for mobile applications.

Toutorial#(005 Setting up Chrome tools for React)
React-Detector>>>Website of react and it becomes blue.
React Developer Tools-> it tells about the react components used in a website.    

Toutorial #(006 Inspecting React sites)
  Developer tools shortcut: ctrl+opt+j or F12

Toutorial#(007 Efficient rendering with React)

The DOM: Document object model(Sutructure of HTML elements);
DOM Diffing: More efficient in making changes of when page reload,it compares the current page with 
new changing request and only make changes which are to be updated.
 
 Tutorial#(Pure React)
       created an element and displayed it.

  Tutorial#( Babel inline transpiling)
    To Compile JSX we use babel.(JSX is like HTML syntax written in Javascript Code)
    so if it does not supported by browser directly then we use Babel.

    Tutorial#( Babel static transpiling with babel-cli)
    
Creating a new Project
>>>     npm init
>>>     npm install --save-dev babel-cli
or for global 
>>>     npm install -g babel-cli

>>>     npm install --save-dev babel-preset-latest babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-0

>>>     babel ./src/index.js --out-file ./dist/bundle.js
 Tutorial#(Building with webpack)
  Webpack makes html,javascript,css as a single file and makes it as a single request.
  It all happens before puttingout our website live or before producing our file.

  devserver is like httpster but it loads the changes automatically. 
  
Installing webpack:

>>>>    npm install webpack babel-loader webpack-dev-server --save-dev

The CLI moved into a separate package: webpack-cli.
Please install 'webpack-cli' in addition to webpack itself to use the CLI.
-> When using npm: npm install webpack-cli -D
Try Following:

> Install Webpack 2 => npm install webpack@2
> Output file path should be absolute
> "loaders" keyword is replaced by "rules" keyword
> Remove "query" and "persist" sectio n
> Remove Public path


To run webpack:
webpack --mode development

To run webpack continuously (Keep watching):
webpack --mode development -w

Toturial#( Loading JSON with webpack)
export const hello= ("export" so that content stored in hello can be used in other files.)

Toturial#(014 Adding CSS to webpack build)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46400443/what-is-the-difference-between-css-and-scss
 Our webpack will transpile our "CSS" file into "SCSS" file.
 these loaders will help in transpiling css.

 Toturial#(015 Planning an ActivityCounter)
 U can choose data points of your desired field,
 there will be 
 location,
 date,
 two boolean variables

 Example:  location, lahore
           date, 31 march 2017
           normal day,
           hot day
 Toturial#(016 Creating components with createClass())
Multiple components will be created and purpose of each component will be to display data.
The <span> tag provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document.
component will be created using react.createclass 
npm install create-react-class --save -dev

Toturial#(017 Adding component properties)
<span>{this.propTypes.total}</span>
                    <span>5 days</span>
if we are using this.proptypes.total then no need of hardcode 5,
PropTypes exports a range of validators that can be used to make sure 
the data you receive is valid.  For performance reasons, propTypes is 
only checked in development mode.

Toturial#(018 Adding component methods)

      We will create some methods for components and thses methods will be incapsulated in components.
      Methods are functions stored as object properties.
Toturial#(019 Creating components with ES6 class syntax)
ES6 describes that how Javascript should be implemented for browsers.

Changed our class as ES6 class, only make changes in syntax..
To be more specific in syntax we use Important {component} from
react instead of import React from 'react'.

Creating stateless functional components
        Intro: React .14 introduced a simpler way to define components called stateless functional components.
         These components use plain JavaScript functions. Hereâ€™s the before and after in ES6:  

   So we will be creating a component using a function.
   Note: For Allighment of the code use "shift+tab".
   thses stateless function just take the properties as input
    and displays the data.

    export const SkiDayCount= (props) =>(

    So we can easily use this function in current or any other component.
Toutorial#(021 Adding react-icons)

 Toturial#(022 Composing components)
Purpose will be to build a skidy table.

Toturial#(023 Displaying child components)
Skiday list and skiday roes were our child process.
The <tr> tag defines a row in an HTML table
The <td> tag defines a standard cell in an HTML table.
The <th> tag defines a header cell in an HTML table.
The <tbody> tag is used to group the body content in an HTML table.
Whenever we are rendering a childeren in aray we have to supply a key value
so that react can know which things to be update..
